# Preprints

Collection of preprints that I want to generate links to share

## Example Usage 

If you want to generate a shareable link for `document.pdf`, then: 
1. Upload `document.pdf` to branch `main`, and commit changes
2. Github pages will generate the link at `https://AdityaGahlawat.github.io/Preprints/document.pdf`
